PDF Query Assistant is an intelligent web application that allows users to extract information from PDF documents using natural language queries. It supports both text-based and scanned PDFs through OCR technology, powered by the Mistral AI model via Ollama.

## üöÄ Features
- üìÑ **PDF Upload & Processing**: Upload PDF documents via drag-and-drop or file browser.
- üîç **Dual Extraction Methods**
  - Text extraction from standard PDFs using PyMuPDF.
  - OCR processing for scanned PDFs using Tesseract.

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Querying**: Ask natural language questions about your PDF content using the Mistral model.

- üì± **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional interface with dark mode support.

- ‚ö° **Real-time Processing**: Instant responses to your PDF queries.

- üìä **Content Analysis**: Extract insights, summaries, and specific information from documents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Processing**: Ollama with Mistral model
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Uvicorn ASGI server

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuvakunaal/ChatWithPDF-AI.git
cd ChatWithPDF-AI
```
### Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pymupdf ollama pydantic python-multipart pillow pytesseract
```
### Install Tesseract OCR
- Windows: Download from UB-Mannheim/tesseract
- macOS: ```bash brew install tesseract```
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): ```bash sudo apt install tesseract-ocr```
- Linux (Fedora): ```bash sudo dnf install tesseract```

### Download Ollama

   - Visit the [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai) and download the application.
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     ollama pull mistral:instruct
     ```
   - The Ollama model is now downloaded on your system.

### Run the Application
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
**Open Browser** : Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8020/

# üéØ How It Works

**Upload PDF**: Drag and drop or select a PDF file.

**Automatic Processing**:
- The system first attempts standard text extraction.
- If text content is minimal (scanned PDF), it automatically uses OCR.

**Ask Questions**: Type natural language questions about the document.

**Get Answers**: AI analyzes the PDF content and provides accurate responses.

# üîÆ Usage Examples

Ask questions like:
- "What is this document about?"
- "Summarize the main points."
- "List all the key findings."
- "What are the recommendations in section 3?"
- "Extract all dates mentioned in the document."
- "Who are the authors of this paper?"

The application analyzes the PDF content and provides precise answers based solely on the document information.


# üåü Advanced Features

- ü§ñ **Intelligent Context Handling**: AI understands document structure and references specific sections.
- üìÑ **Scanned PDF Support**: Automatic OCR processing for image-based PDFs.
- üîí **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally on your machine.
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Efficient text extraction and query processing.
- üì± **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
